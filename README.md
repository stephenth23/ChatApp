# chat_app

This mini-application is created in python, while I wanted to create a mini WhatsApp for my house (localhost).

The app lets you create a home-server over your IP, and based on that the file "client.py" takes your IP, the server IP, your name, and then lets you communicate with all the users connected to the server.
